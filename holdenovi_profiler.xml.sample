This configuration file is used to configure Holdenovi_Profiler. Since profiling starts long before the configuration is being read
these settings can't be core_config_data (System > Configuration)

If you run Magento on multiple nodes makes sure this file is present on configured correctly on every node that's supposed to
log data.

This file is expected to be in var/holdenovi_profiler.xml

        'always': Every request will be logged (filters apply if enabled...)
        'never': nothing will be logged. (The absence of this xml configuration implies 'never')
        'parameter': controlled via get parameter '?profile=1' or cookie (profile).
        Check System > Configuration for bookmarklets.

        If this is set to '0' (and profiling triggered) EVERY request will be logged.
        This may end in a lot of data and in a general performance loss of your site.
        This is only recommended on dev environments.
        If set to '1' the following filters apply.

            This controls how many samples will be recorded. Other filters still apply. Examples:
            100 => every request will be logged
            25 => only every fourth request will be logged
            0.01 => only one in 10,000 requests will be logged.
